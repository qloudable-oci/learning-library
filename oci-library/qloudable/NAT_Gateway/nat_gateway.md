## Overview

Many Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers have compute instances in virtual cloud networks (VCNs) that, for privacy, security, or operational concerns, are connected to private subnets. To grant these resources access to the public internet for software updates, CRL checks, and so on, a customer’s only option has been to create a NAT instance in a public subnet and route traffic through that instance by using its private IP address as a route target from within the private subnet. Although many have successfully used this approach, it does not scale easily and provides a myriad of administrative and operational challenges.

NAT gateway,  addresses these challenges and provides Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers with a simple and intuitive tool to address their networking security needs. NAT gateways provide the following features:

- Highly Scalable and Fully Managed: Instances on private subnets can initiate large numbers of connections to the public internet. Connections initiated from the internet are blocked.

- Secure: Traffic through NAT gateways can be disabled with the Click of a button.
Dedicated IP Addresses: Each NAT gateway is assigned a dedicated IP address that can be reliably added to security whitelists.

- Subnet access:Private Subnet.
- DHCP Options: Select the default.
- Security Lists: Select the Security List you created earlier.

6. Leave all other options as default, Click **Create Subnet**.

7. Switch to Git bash session with ssh to compute instance Generate ssh key pair, Enter command:

`ssh-keygen` 

8. Press Enter When asked for ‘Enter File in which to save the key’, ‘Created Directory, ‘Enter passphrase’, and ‘Enter Passphrase  again.

9. Enter command 

`cd ~/.ssh`

and then 

`ls`

You should have the Public and Private keys:

/home/opc/.ssh/id_rsa (Private Key)
/home/opc/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (Public Key)

10. Enter command 

`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

copy and paste the public key content to Notepad. We will use this public key to launch a compute instance in private subnet of the VCN.

11. Switch to OCI console window and launch a second compute instance as done previously. **Ensure the subnet chosen is the private subnet that we created previously**.

12. Once the Instance is running, Note down private IP address of the instance from instance detail page (by Clicking Instance name) 

13. Switch to git-bash window with ssh session to Public compute instance (first compute instance created earlier). Enter command:

`cd ~/.ssh`

then

`ssh –i id_rsa opc@<Private_IP_OF_COMPUTE_INSTANCE>`

**NOTE:** User name is ‘opc’

**HINT:** If ‘Permission denied error’ is seen, ensure you are using ‘-i’ in the ssh command

**NOTE:** Use the private ip of second compute instance noted earlier

14. Enter ‘Yes’ when prompted for security message

15. In the private compute instance Enter command:

`ping 8.8.8.8` 

and verify there is internet connectivity

**The compute instance in private subnet has internet access. This is possible since traffic is being routed through the NAT gateway that we created and attached to the VCN. Next we will use the traffic toggle function on NAT gateway to block/allow traffic with a single Click.**

16. Switch to OCI console window. In your VCN's detail page, Click **NAT Gateways**

17. Hover over the Action icon  and choose Block Traffic. 

18. Switch back to ssh session to the private compute instance and Enter command ping 8.8.8.8 (if not already running). Verify there is no repsonse
